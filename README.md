## User Experience (UX) & Agile Planning and Development

### Goals and Objectives 
The aim of this website is to provide an intuitive, responsive and rich community focussed platform to connect, share and discover content. 

Users are able to log in and create a personalized list of their favorite item, submit their own content, and interact with other user's contents through the format of likes, dislikes and comments.

### Scope 

#### User Features:
- Responsive design across different devices 
- CRUD functionality for the recipe posts, comments and favorites section
- Authentication and account management 

Only owners of data such as recipe posts or comments can access CRUD functionality related to their own content. 

#### Admin Features: 
- Manage user posts and comments
- Monitor and remove inappropriate content from the admin interface
