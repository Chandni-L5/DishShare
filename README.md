## User Experience (UX) & Agile Planning and Development

### Goals and Objectives 
The aim of this website is to provide an intuitive, responsive and rich community focussed platform to connect, share and discover content. 

Users are able to log in and create a personalized list of their favorite item, submit their own content, and interact with other user's contents through the format of likes, dislikes and comments.

### Scope 

#### User Features:
- Responsive design across different devices 
- CRUD functionality for the recipe posts, comments and favorites section
- Authentication and account management 

Only owners of data such as recipe posts or comments can access CRUD functionality related to their own content. 

#### Admin Features: 
- Manage user posts and comments
- Monitor and remove inappropriate content from the admin interface

### Agile Development and Planning

#### User Stories
The development and the planning of this project has been created with the Agile methodologies in mind throughout. 

Epics have been condensed to bitesize user stories.

ðŸ“š The epics can be viewed [here](/documentation/epics.md)

ðŸ““ The user stories can be viewed [here](/documentation/user-stories.md)

 The implementation and prioritization of user stories as well as the acceptance criteria is recorded and tracked dynamically through the use of GitHub Projects Kanban board. The Kanban board records the user story, acceptance criteria and tasks. These are checked off as we progress through the project.

ðŸ“Š The board can be viewed [here](https://github.com/users/Chandni-L5/projects/11/views/3)

#### Estimation

I have used the MoSCoW prioritization method to categorize each user story according to the project requirements. These categories are also represented on the Kanban board with colored labels for easy reference by the development team. At the start of the project, 'Wonâ€™t have' items will not be applied, but this will be reassessed as progress is made.

During planning, the MoSCoW priorities were distributed as 50% Must have, 33% Should have, and 17% Could have.

<!-- Update if any of the user stories have been moved to won't have -->

To support estimation, I have assigned story points based on a Fibonacci methodology, reflecting the relative complexity of each story. This scale will guide the prioritization and ordering of tasks during development.

| Requirement | User Story | AC Numbers | Story Points | Complexity |
|------------|------------|------------|--------------|------------|
| ðŸŸ¥ Must have | **Open a post** | AC1 | 2 | ðŸŸ¢ Small |
| ðŸŸ¥ Must have | **Navbar and Footer** | AC1, AC2, AC3 | 2 | ðŸŸ¢ Small |
| ðŸŸ¥ Must have | **Account registration** | AC1, AC2, AC3 | 5 | ðŸŸ¡ Medium |
| ðŸŸ¥ Must have | **Responsive design** | AC1 | 3-5 | ðŸŸ¡ Medium |

| ðŸŸ© Could have | **Favorite recipes** | AC1, AC2 | 3-5 | ðŸŸ¡ Medium |
| ðŸŸ© Could have| **Like and dislike posts** | AC1, AC2, AC3 | 5-8 | ðŸŸ  Large |
