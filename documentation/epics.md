# Epics

The project has been designed and structured around a set of epics, which represent the functionality of the platform. These epics are then broken down into bitesize chunks of user stories to help identify the needs and goals of the users and the administrator of the website. The success of the needs and goals is accessed using an acceptance criteria. 

The Epics have been split into a number of themes:

## Content Epic
- Functionality to be able to create, edit, publish and view the recipe posts

## User Account & Authentication Epic
- Users are able to register an account, as well as logging in and out
- Registered users are able to access account based functionality such as submitting their own content, liking and disliking content, commenting on content and favoriting content to add to a personalized list.

## User Engagement Epic
- Functionality to like or dislike existing content
- Ability to comment on existing content
- Users to be able to select recipes to add to a personal favorites page

## Moderation and Administration Epic
- Admin can moderate by approving and removing content and comments as necessary 
- Admin can create, edit and delete content
